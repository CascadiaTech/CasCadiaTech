### We Build, anything and everything. Code is humanities greatest tool to build a future we never could have imagined. We use it as intended, lets build something cool.

To those that are on this repository I have many past projects public, the only one that is really cool that I cant show you is rexprotocol.com due to the whole sensistive information thing, but I leave them public so that anyone looking to learn what I do can use my code to learn and make projects themselves :) goodluck traveler. Our skillsets include: Nexjs, React, the MERN stack, solidity, python, and a little bit of C#
